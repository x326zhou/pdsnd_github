### Project Title
BikeShare Project

### Description
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

In this project, we will use data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.
